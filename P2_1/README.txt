In this folder, P2_1, is a collection of two small programs.

The first, Ex1, is a program using simple variables in JavaScript. Being used is a number type, "age", string type, "name", and boolean type, "canVote".
There is a small code block using an if, else, conditional to output different messages to the HTML and the console depending on the value of the "age" variable.

The second, Ex2, is a program very similar to the first. The difference is that the second uses an object, person, to hold the other variables.
The person object has the properties "name", "age", and boolean "canVote".
It also has a method function called "votingEligible", which is the if, else, code block from the first exercise.
