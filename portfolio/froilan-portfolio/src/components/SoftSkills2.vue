          I've spent all my life adapting to different situations, having moved from
          place to place every couple of years. I know the value of being able to pivot 
          to confront whatever the current situation brings. I apply this mindset to 
          whatever challenge I face

        <li class="list-group-item active">Diligence</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" align='justify'>
          I've been no stranger to a heavy workload. The key to getting through is 
          patience, endurance, and a willingess to work hard. I do my best to put this into practice
          and show that I am eager to work.

        <li class="list-group-item active">Time Management</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" align="justify">
          Another key to dealing with numerous taks is to manage time well. Having had
          many responsibilites, I'm accustomed to balancing between different obligations, 
          so that I can always deliver what is required of me in a timely
          manner.
